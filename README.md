<div align="center">

This branch features a "stripped down" version of m0rehud, this version doesn't include any customizations or extra edits, this is effectively a 2011 m0rehud updated to work with the current TF2 updates. This version won't be updated as often as I intend to update it only for bug fixes and TF2 updates (not many nowadays uh)
